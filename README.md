# INSURANCE_DATA_PROJECT
## Insurance Data Analysis and Data Visualization

I have done Analysis on Brnach data and policy data to get meaningful insights by using Excel and MySQL and Visualize the findings with Excel, PowerBI and Tableau.
This insurance data analytics project aims to develop data-driven dashboards for stakeholders, helping corporate teams and branch heads track sales performance, policy distribution, and financial trends.
1. Boost Sales & Revenue – Track new business, renewals, and premium growth. 
2. Improve Customer Insights – Analyze policy distribution by demographics (age, gender, type). 
3. Enhance Branch Performance – Assess account executive contributions and revenue trends. 
4. Optimize Claims & Risk Management – Monitor claim status and financial impact. 
5. Support Strategic Decisions – Enable data-driven strategies for business expansion. 

This concise yet impactful structure ensures clarity for all stakeholders.
